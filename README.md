Hello, glad to see you here.

Briefly about the project:
- I deliberately complicated it. Just for fun.
- for convenience all services are collected into one project.
- I didnâ€™t have time to finish everything, so interfaces, tests, naming, configs, etc. were only partially delivered)
- deep directory nesting is my PHP heritage.
